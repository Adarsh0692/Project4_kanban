# Description
This is a simple implementation of a Kanban Board, a tool that helps visualize and manage work. Originally it was first created in Toyota automotive, but nowadays it's widely used in software development.

A Kanban Board is usually made of 3 columns - TODO, InProgress & Done. In each column there are Post-it notes that represents task and their status.
