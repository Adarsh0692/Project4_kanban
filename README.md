# Project Title
Kanban Board
# Description
This is a simple implementation of a Kanban Board, a tool that helps visualize and manage work. Originally it was first created in Toyota automotive, but nowadays it's widely used in software development.

A Kanban Board is usually made of 3 columns - But in this Kanban Board user can create multiple list and inside list they can create multiple task also. And whenever user will click on a perticuler task and then it will navigate dynamically to the description page where they can add a description for that perticuler task and also comments on that activity.
